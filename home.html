A component of supply chain management, inventory management supervises the flow of goods from manufacturers to warehouses and from these facilities to point of sale.<br><br>Effective inventory management is all about knowing what is on hand, where it is in use, and how much finished product results. Inventory management is the process of efficiently overseeing the constant flow of units into and out of an existing inventory.<br><br>Inventory control is something that should be front-of-mind for anyone in the wholesale distribution business. In the simplest of terms, inventory control involves having greater oversight over one’s stock. Some refer to it as “internal control” or even as an accounting system set up to safeguard assets. Let’s take a look at why inventory control is so important as well as what’s involved in developing an effective system.<br>Understanding what you have, where it is in your warehouse, and when stock is going in and out can help lower costs, speed up fulfillment, and prevent fraud. Your company may also rely on inventory control systems to assess your current assets, balance your accounts, and provide financial reporting.<br>Inventory control is also important to maintaining the right balance of stock in your warehouses. You don’t want to lose a sale because you didn’t have enough inventory to fill an order. Constant inventory issues (frequent backorders, etc.) can drive customers to other suppliers entirely. The bottom line? When you have control over your inventory, you’re able to provide better customer service. It will also help you get a better, more real-time understanding of what’s selling and what isn’t.<br>You also don’t want to have excess inventory taking up space in your warehouses unnecessarily. Too much inventory can trigger profit losses--whether a product expires, gets damaged, or goes out of season. Key to proper inventory control is a deeper understanding of customer demand for your products.<br><br>Purpose of Inventory Management<br>INVENTORY MANAGEMENT must tie together the following objectives ,to ensure that there is continuity between functions :<br>• Company’s Strategic Goals<br>• Sales Forecasting <br>• Sales &amp; Operations Planning<br>• Production &amp; Materials Requirement Planning.<br><br></span></div>
